## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Services**
   - Tests use mocked AWS services, not actual services
   - Suitable for development and CI/CD
   - Optional: Can be extended to use real services

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Tests don't persist data to actual databases
   - In-memory storage used for test isolation
   - Ensures test independence

3. **Network Latency**
   - Simulated delays may not match production exactly
   - Configurable delay values
   - Can be tuned based on production metrics

4. **Concurrent Limits**
   - Tests limited to reasonable concurrency levels
   - Prevents resource exhaustion in test environment
   - Can be increased for stress testing

### Medium Term
3. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Screenshot comparison for UI components
   - Detect unintended visual changes
   - Integration with Percy or similar

4. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Establish baseline metrics
   - Track performance trends
   - Alert on regressions

### Long Term
5. **Real Service Integration**
   - Optional tests against actual AWS services
   - Separate test environment
   - Scheduled execution

6. **Mutation Testing**
   - Verify test quality
   - Identify weak tests
   - Improve test effectiveness
