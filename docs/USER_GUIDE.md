### Automatic Quality Checks

When you submit a deliverable, the system automatically:
1. Validates file format and structure
2. Checks completeness against requirements
3. Verifies compliance with standards
4. Generates quality score

### Understanding Quality Scores

```
Quality Assessment Results:
Overall Score: 85/100 ✓ PASSED

Breakdown:
✓ Format: 95/100
  - Well-structured code
  - Follows style guidelines

✓ Completeness: 90/100
  - All required features implemented
  - Minor: Missing optional error handling

⚠️ Compliance: 80/100
  - Meets security standards
  - Improvement: Add input validation for edge cases
```

### Quality Score Ranges

- **90-100**: Excellent - Ready for production
- **75-89**: Good - Minor improvements recommended
- **60-74**: Acceptable - Several improvements needed
- **Below 60**: Needs Work - Significant revisions required

### Responding to Quality Feedback

**If Score is Below 75**:
1. Review detailed feedback
2. Address identified issues
3. Resubmit deliverable
4. Request re-assessment

**Improvement Suggestions**:
The system provides specific, actionable suggestions:
```
Improvement Suggestions:
1. Add input validation for user email field
   Location: auth.js, line 45
   Example: Use email validation library

2. Implement rate limiting for login endpoint
   Location: routes/auth.js
   Example: Add express-rate-limit middleware

3. Add unit tests for password reset flow
   Coverage: Currently 65%, target 80%
