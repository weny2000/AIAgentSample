# Authentication Infrastructure Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 3: "Implement IAM roles and authentication infrastructure" for the AI Agent System.

## Implemented Components

### 1. IAM Roles (`src/constructs/iam-roles.ts`)

✅ **Lambda Execution Role**
- VPC access permissions for private subnet deployment
- KMS access for encryption/decryption operations
- S3 access to documents, artifacts, and audit logs buckets
- DynamoDB access for team roster and audit logs
- Secrets Manager access for external service credentials
- Kendra access for search operations
- Step Functions access for workflow orchestration
- SQS access for job queuing
- Comprehend access for PII detection
- CloudWatch Logs access for monitoring

✅ **ECS Task Role**
- Similar permissions to Lambda but optimized for containerized workloads
- External API access for static analysis tools
- Focused on heavy processing tasks

✅ **ECS Execution Role**
- Container image pulling from ECR
- CloudWatch Logs for container logging
- Secrets Manager for container secrets

✅ **API Gateway Role**
- CloudWatch Logs access for API logging
- Lambda function invocation permissions

✅ **Step Functions Role**
- Lambda function invocation
- ECS task execution
- IAM pass role for ECS tasks
- CloudWatch Logs for workflow monitoring

### 2. Authentication Infrastructure (`src/constructs/authentication.ts`)

✅ **Cognito User Pool**
- OIDC-compliant authentication
- Strong password policies (12+ chars, complexity requirements)
- MFA required (TOTP)
- Custom attributes for ABAC: department, team_id, role, clearance
- Self-signup disabled (admin-managed users)
- Device tracking enabled

✅ **SAML Integration**
- SAML identity provider configured
- Attribute mapping for custom claims
- Ready for enterprise SSO integration

✅ **Cognito User Pool Client**
- SPA-optimized configuration
- Authorization code flow (more secure than implicit)
- Token validity: 1 hour for access/ID tokens, 30 days for refresh
- Token revocation enabled

✅ **Cognito Identity Pool**
- Federated identity management
- Integration with User Pool
- Server-side token validation

✅ **Lambda Authorizer**
- JWT token verification using aws-jwt-verify
- User attribute extraction
- Policy generation based on user context
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. ABAC Policies

✅ **S3 ABAC Policy**
- Team-boundary access control using team_id attribute
- Path-based access: `${team_id}/*`
- Separate permissions for documents and artifacts buckets

✅ **DynamoDB ABAC Policy**
- Team roster access restricted by team_id
- Audit log write permissions with attribute validation
- Leading key constraints for data isolation

✅ **API ABAC Policy**
- Clearance-based access control:
  - Basic: status, query, search endpoints
  - Standard: artifact checks, notifications, issue creation
  - Elevated: persona management
  - Admin: policy management, audit access

### 4. Authentication Middleware (`src/constructs/auth-middleware.ts`)

✅ **JWT Verification**
- Token validation using Cognito JWT verifier
- Comprehensive error handling for expired/invalid tokens
- Correlation ID tracking for request tracing

✅ **Team Access Validation**
- DynamoDB team roster verification
- Role consistency checking
- Membership validation

✅ **Resource-Level Authorization**
- Permission matrix based on clearance levels
- Path and method-based access control
- Wildcard pattern matching for flexible permissions

✅ **Security Event Logging**
- Authentication success/failure events
- Audit trail in DynamoDB
- Correlation ID tracking
- Error details for security monitoring

✅ **Pre-Token Generation Trigger**
- Team-specific claims injection
- Session metadata addition
- Dynamic attribute enhancement

### 5. Lambda Layer (`src/constructs/lambda-layer.ts`)

✅ **Dependency Management**
- Shared authentication dependencies
- aws-jwt-verify library
- AWS SDK components
- Optimized for reuse across Lambda functions

## Security Features

### Encryption
- All data encrypted at rest using KMS customer-managed keys
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Automatic key rotation enabled

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Team boundary enforcement
- Role-based permissions

### Audit & Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event tracking
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Immutable audit logs with object lock

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Strong password policies
- Token-based authentication with short expiry
- Device tracking and management

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 5.1**: OIDC authentication via Cognito User Pool with SAML support
✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Comprehensive audit logging with user identity, timestamps, and action details
✅ **Requirement 5.3**: KMS encryption for sensitive data
✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Secrets Manager integration for external credentials
✅ **Requirement 5.5**: Security alerts and access blocking for unauthorized attempts

## Deployment Notes

1. **Node.js Version**: Requires Node.js 18+ for CDK deployment
2. **SAML Configuration**: SAML metadata URL needs to be updated post-deployment
3. **User Pool Domain**: Automatically configured with account-specific prefix
4. **Custom Attributes**: Pre-configured for ABAC requirements
5. **Lambda Layers**: Dependencies need to be built and packaged separately

## Testing

The implementation has been verified through:
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Construct instantiation testing
- Policy validation
- Integration testing framework ready

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to development environment
2. Configure SAML identity provider
3. Create initial user accounts with proper attributes
4. Test authentication flows
5. Validate ABAC policies with real users
6. Set up monitoring and alerting
