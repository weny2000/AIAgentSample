# Task 11: RDS Construct Tagging Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of resource-specific tags for the RDS PostgreSQL construct as part of the AWS Resource Tagging feature.

## Implementation Date
October 6, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated RDS PostgreSQL Construct
**File**: `infrastructure/src/constructs/rds-postgresql.ts`

#### Imports Added
- Imported `TagManager` from `../utils/tag-manager`

#### Tagging Implementation
- Initialized `TagManager` with the deployment stage
- Determined backup policy based on backup retention configuration:
  - Production (30 days retention) → "Daily"
  - Non-production (7 days retention) → "Weekly"
- Applied resource-specific tags to RDS instance:
  - `Component`: "Database-RDS"
  - `Engine`: "PostgreSQL"
  - `DataClassification`: "Confidential"
  - `BackupPolicy`: Dynamically determined based on stage
- Applied tags to read replica (production only):
  - Same tags as primary instance
  - Additional `ReplicaType`: "ReadReplica" tag

### 2. Created Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `infrastructure/src/constructs/__tests__/rds-postgresql-tagging.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage
- **Tag Application Tests**:
  - Verifies Component tag is applied correctly
  - Verifies Engine tag with PostgreSQL value
  - Verifies DataClassification tag with Confidential value
  - Verifies BackupPolicy tag for dev environment (Weekly)
  - Verifies BackupPolicy tag for prod environment (Daily)
  - Verifies all required tags are present
  - Verifies read replica tags in production
  - Verifies no read replica in non-production environments

- **Database Configuration Tests**:
  - Verifies encryption at rest is enabled
  - Verifies backup retention based on stage
  - Verifies performance insights is enabled

#### Test Results
All 11 tests passing:
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       11 passed, 11 total
```

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 2.4 (RDS Resource-Specific Tagging)
✅ **WHEN RDS instances are created THEN the system SHALL apply tags including:**
- Component: "Database-RDS" ✓
- Engine: database engine type ✓
- DataClassification: data sensitivity level ✓
- BackupPolicy: retention policy ✓

### Requirement 5.4 (Data Classification for Storage Resources)
✅ **WHEN data storage resources are created THEN the system SHALL require DataClassification tag**
- RDS instances tagged with "Confidential" classification ✓

## Technical Details

### Backup Policy Logic
The backup policy is determined dynamically based on the backup retention period:
```typescript
const backupRetentionDays = props.stage === 'prod' ? 30 : 7;
const backupPolicy = backupRetentionDays >= 30 ? 'Daily' : backupRetentionDays >= 7 ? 'Weekly' : 'None';
```

### Tag Application
Tags are applied using the TagManager utility:
```typescript
const tagManager = new TagManager(null, props.stage);
const rdsTags = tagManager.getResourceTags('rds', 'Database');
tagManager.applyTags(this.database, {
  ...rdsTags,
  Engine: 'PostgreSQL',
  DataClassification: 'Confidential',
  BackupPolicy: backupPolicy,
});
```

### Read Replica Tagging
Production read replicas receive the same tags as the primary instance, plus an additional `ReplicaType` tag:
```typescript
if (readReplica) {
  tagManager.applyTags(readReplica, {
    ...rdsTags,
    Engine: 'PostgreSQL',
    DataClassification: 'Confidential',
    BackupPolicy: backupPolicy,
    ReplicaType: 'ReadReplica',
  });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Cost Allocation**: RDS costs can now be tracked by component, environment, and backup policy
2. **Compliance**: DataClassification tag ensures compliance with data governance policies
3. **Operational Visibility**: Engine and BackupPolicy tags provide clear operational context
4. **Automated Management**: Tags enable automated backup and lifecycle management policies
5. **Security Auditing**: Confidential classification enables security monitoring and access control

## Integration Points

- **TagManager**: Centralized tag management utility
- **Tag Configuration**: Uses environment-specific tag values from tag-config.ts
- **CDK Tags API**: Leverages AWS CDK's built-in tagging mechanism

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- 11 comprehensive tests covering all tagging scenarios
- Tests verify both primary instance and read replica tagging
- Tests validate backup policy logic for different environments

### Test Execution
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm test -- rds-postgresql-tagging.test.ts
```

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain in the AWS Resource Tagging implementation:
- Task 12: Update VPC and network resources with tags
- Task 13: Update API Gateway construct with tags
- Task 14: Update Step Functions construct with tags
- Task 15: Update monitoring construct with tags
- Task 16: Update authentication construct with tags
- Task 17: Update KMS key with tags
- Task 18: Update WorkTaskS3Storage construct with tags
- Tasks 19-25: Validation, documentation, and deployment integration

## Conclusion

Task 11 has been successfully completed. The RDS PostgreSQL construct now applies comprehensive, standardized tags that support cost allocation, compliance tracking, and operational management. All tests pass, and the implementation follows the established tagging patterns from previous tasks.
