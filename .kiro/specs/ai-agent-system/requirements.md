# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI Agent system that functions as a "digital twin" for team leaders within an organization. The system will operate on a private knowledge base, integrating with various enterprise tools (Slack, Teams, Jira, Confluence, Git, S3) to provide intelligent assistance, cross-team impact analysis, and automated artifact verification. The system will be implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using JavaScript/React with a serverless backend architecture on AWS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team member, I want an AI agent that acts as my team leader's digital twin, so that I can receive consistent guidance and support even when my leader is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries the AI agent THEN the system SHALL respond using the configured leader persona and knowledge base
2. WHEN the agent provides guidance THEN it SHALL reference relevant company policies, project rules, and industry standards
3. WHEN multiple team members interact with the same leader's agent THEN the system SHALL provide consistent responses based on the leader's documented preferences and decisions
4. IF a query requires leader-specific decision-making THEN the system SHALL escalate to the actual leader with context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team leader, I want to configure my AI agent with my leadership style and decision-making patterns, so that it can accurately represent my guidance to team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a leader accesses the admin interface THEN the system SHALL provide persona configuration options including leadership style, common decisions, and escalation criteria
2. WHEN a leader updates their persona configuration THEN the system SHALL version the changes and apply them to future agent interactions
3. WHEN configuring the persona THEN the system SHALL allow leaders to define team-specific rules and preferences
4. IF persona configuration conflicts with company policies THEN the system SHALL flag the conflict and require resolution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the system to analyze cross-team dependencies and impacts, so that I can understand how changes in one team affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests impact analysis for a proposed change THEN the system SHALL identify affected teams, services, and dependencies
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use the knowledge base to map relationships between teams, services, and artifacts
3. WHEN impact analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a visual representation of affected components and recommended stakeholders to notify
4. IF high-risk impacts are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag them and suggest mitigation strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit artifacts for automated verification, so that I can ensure compliance with standards before formal review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an artifact THEN the system SHALL perform static analysis checks based on the artifact type
2. WHEN static checks are complete THEN the system SHALL run semantic validation using LLM-powered analysis
3. WHEN all checks are complete THEN the system SHALL generate a compliance report with scores, issues, and recommendations
4. IF critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL prevent artifact approval and provide specific remediation guidance
5. WHEN verification passes the threshold THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with formal submission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all system interactions to be secure and auditable, so that I can maintain compliance and investigate issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN authentication SHALL be performed via OIDC through IAM Identity Center or SAML
2. WHEN any system action is performed THEN it SHALL be logged with user identity, timestamp, action details, and data sources referenced
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest using KMS and in transit using TLS
4. WHEN external integrations are used THEN credentials SHALL be stored in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block access and generate security alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to search and query the organizational knowledge base, so that I can find relevant information quickly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search query THEN the system SHALL search across integrated data sources (Slack, Teams, Jira, Confluence, Git, S3)
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL include source attribution and access control verification
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL cite specific sources and provide confidence scores
4. IF a user lacks access to referenced content THEN the system SHALL exclude that content from results and indicate access restrictions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage data ingestion from various enterprise tools, so that the knowledge base stays current and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring data sources THEN the system SHALL support connectors for Slack, Teams, Jira, Confluence, Git repositories, and S3 buckets
2. WHEN ingesting data THEN the system SHALL preserve original access controls and team boundaries
3. WHEN new data is ingested THEN it SHALL be processed for PII detection and masking before indexing
4. IF ingestion fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data is updated in source systems THEN the knowledge base SHALL reflect changes within the configured sync interval

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to define and manage organizational policies and rules, so that automated checks enforce current standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating policy rules THEN the system SHALL support both static checks (format, structure) and semantic checks (content analysis)
2. WHEN rules are updated THEN changes SHALL go through an approval workflow before deployment
3. WHEN rules are applied THEN the system SHALL version them and maintain an audit trail of changes
4. IF rule conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them and require resolution before activation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive notifications and create issues based on automated findings, so that I can take appropriate action on identified problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated checks identify issues THEN the system SHALL send notifications via Slack or Teams
2. WHEN critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL offer to create Jira tickets with detailed context
3. WHEN creating tickets THEN the system SHALL require user approval before making changes to external systems
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log delivery status

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system user, I want an intuitive web interface to interact with all system features, so that I can efficiently accomplish my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system THEN users SHALL see a responsive SPA built with React
2. WHEN viewing results THEN the interface SHALL clearly display source references, confidence scores, and action options
3. WHEN performing long-running operations THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
5. IF the user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to authentication without losing work context
