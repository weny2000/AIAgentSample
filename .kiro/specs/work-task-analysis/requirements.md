# Work Task Intelligent Analysis System Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a Work Task Intelligent Analysis System that allows users to submit work task content through a frontend interface, where a backend AI agent automatically analyzes the task content, searches project-specific knowledge bases, extracts key points, identifies related workgroups, and generates structured todo lists. The system will integrate with existing AI agent infrastructure to provide intelligent task analysis and project management support.

4. IF the task is complex THEN the system SHALL break down large tasks into manageable subtasks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the system to be able to extract key points from task content so that I can quickly understand the core information of the task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing task content THEN the system SHALL extract the task's main objectives, key milestones, and important constraints
2. WHEN extracting key points THEN the system SHALL use text summarization techniques to generate concise and clear key point lists
3. WHEN generating key points THEN the system SHALL sort and categorize key points according to importance
4. IF key points involve risks or dependencies THEN the system SHALL specially mark them and provide risk assessments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to be able to view complete task analysis reports so that I can comprehensively understand analysis results and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports containing all analysis results
2. WHEN displaying reports THEN the interface SHALL clearly show task key points, related workgroups, todo lists, and knowledge base references
3. WHEN users view reports THEN the system SHALL provide interactive functionality allowing users to modify or supplement analysis results
4. IF analysis results need updates THEN the system SHALL support re-analysis and report refresh functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be able to record and audit all task analysis activities so that I can monitor system usage and analysis quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit task analysis requests THEN the system SHALL record user identity, timestamps, task content, and other information
2. WHEN the AI agent performs analysis THEN the system SHALL record the analysis process, knowledge sources used, generated results, and other detailed information
