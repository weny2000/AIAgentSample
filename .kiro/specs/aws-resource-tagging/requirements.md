# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement a comprehensive and consistent tagging strategy across all AWS resources in the AI Agent System infrastructure. Currently, only basic tags (Project, Stage, ManagedBy) are applied at the stack level. This enhancement will add standardized tags to all resources to improve cost allocation, resource management, compliance tracking, security auditing, and operational visibility.

The tagging strategy will support multi-environment deployments (dev, staging, production), enable detailed cost tracking by component and team, facilitate automated resource lifecycle management, and ensure compliance with organizational governance policies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Tag Schema

   - CostCenter: cost allocation identifier
   - Environment: deployment environment type

2. WHEN any AWS resource is created THEN the system SHALL apply the following optional tags based on resource type:
   - DataClassification: sensitivity level (Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted) for data storage resources
   - BackupPolicy: backup retention policy (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/None)
   - ComplianceScope: applicable compliance frameworks (HIPAA/SOC2/GDPR/None)

   - Stage: "dev"
   - Environment: "Development"
   - CostCenter: "Development"
