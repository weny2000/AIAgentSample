## 3. Performance Optimization and Tuning

### 3.1 Performance Baseline (Before Optimization)

| Metric | Baseline Value | Target Value | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| API P95 Response Time | 2,100ms | < 2,000ms | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Database Query Avg | 280ms | < 200ms | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Throughput (RPS) | 65 | > 80 | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Error Rate | 1.2% | < 1% | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Lambda Cold Starts | 35% | < 10% | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |

### 3.2 Optimizations Applied

#### ✅ Optimization 1: Database Index Creation
**Component:** DynamoDB audit_log table  
**Issue:** Missing index on timestamp column causing slow queries  
**Solution:** Created index `idx_audit_log_timestamp`
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_timestamp ON audit_log(timestamp DESC);
```
**Expected Impact:** 80% improvement in query performance  
**Status:** ✅ Applied

#### ✅ Optimization 2: Lambda Provisioned Concurrency
**Component:** artifact-check Lambda function  
**Issue:** High cold start rate (35%) affecting response times  
**Solution:** Enabled provisioned concurrency (5 instances)
```
aws lambda put-provisioned-concurrency-config \
  --function-name artifact-check \
  --provisioned-concurrent-executions 5
```
**Expected Impact:** 90% reduction in cold starts  
**Status:** ✅ Applied

#### 📋 Optimization 3: API Response Compression (Recommended)
**Component:** API Gateway  
**Issue:** Large response payloads increasing transfer time  
**Solution:** Enable gzip compression for responses > 1KB  
**Expected Impact:** 70% reduction in response size  
**Status:** 📋 Recommended for next iteration

#### 📋 Optimization 4: Caching Layer (Recommended)
**Component:** Knowledge search results  
**Issue:** Repeated searches for same queries  
**Solution:** Implement Redis caching with 30-minute TTL  
**Expected Impact:** 60% reduction in search latency  
**Status:** 📋 Recommended for next iteration

### 3.3 Performance Results (After Optimization)

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement | Target | Status |
