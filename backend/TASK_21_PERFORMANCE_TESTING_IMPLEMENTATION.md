## Test Execution

### Running All Performance Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm run test:performance
```

This runs all performance test suites sequentially with proper timeouts and generates a comprehensive report.

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Performance benchmarks only
npm run test:performance:benchmarks

# Load tests only
npm run test:performance:load

# Stress tests only
npm run test:performance:stress

# Database query performance only
npm run test:performance:database
```

### Test Configuration

All tests are configured with appropriate timeouts:
- Performance benchmarks: 60 seconds
- Load tests: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Stress tests: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Database tests: 120 seconds (2 minutes)

Tests run with garbage collection exposed (`--expose-gc`) for accurate memory testing.

2. **Index Utilization**: Use GSI queries instead of scans (50%+ faster)
3. **Projection**: Query only needed attributes to reduce data transfer
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections for better performance
5. **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel segment scans for large datasets

### Future Optimization Opportunities
1. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Query Result Caching**: Cache knowledge base search results
3. **Async Processing**: Use Step Functions for long-running analyses
4. **Content Streaming**: Stream large file uploads instead of buffering
5. **Database Sharding**: Consider sharding for very large datasets

## Test Report Generation

Each test run generates a performance report at:
```
backend/performance-test-report.json
```

The report includes:
- Timestamp of test execution
- Total duration
- Number of test suites
- Pass/fail counts
- Detailed results for each suite

## Monitoring Integration

Performance metrics can be integrated with CloudWatch for production monitoring:
- Response time metrics
- Throughput metrics
- Error rates
- Memory usage
- Database query performance

## Continuous Performance Testing

### CI/CD Integration
Performance tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: npm run test:performance
  timeout-minutes: 15
```

### Performance Regression Detection
Compare performance metrics across builds to detect regressions:
- Response time increases > 20%
- Throughput decreases > 15%
- Memory usage increases > 30%
- Error rate increases > 5%
