```
Title: Fix Login Authentication Timeout Issue
Description: Users are experiencing timeout errors when attempting to login during peak hours (9-10 AM EST)

Content:
## Problem
Users report receiving "Authentication timeout" errors when logging in between 9-10 AM EST. Error rate is approximately 15% during this window.

## Expected Behavior
Users should be able to login successfully within 2 seconds regardless of time of day.

## Technical Details
- Error occurs in auth-service Lambda function
- CloudWatch logs show DynamoDB throttling
- Current timeout setting: 5 seconds
- Peak concurrent users: ~500

## Acceptance Criteria
- Login success rate > 99.5% during peak hours
- Response time < 2 seconds for 95th percentile
- No DynamoDB throttling errors
- Proper error handling and user feedback
