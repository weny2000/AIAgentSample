### Requirement 4.2: Use Team Skill Matrices and Historical Project Data for Matching
✅ **Implemented**: The system leverages:
- Comprehensive skill matrices with proficiency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert)
- Years of experience and last-used dates for each skill
- Historical performance metrics (success rate, quality score, delivery time)
- Similar project experience with similarity scoring
- Historical collaboration data between team pairs

### Requirement 4.3: Provide Contact Information and Professional Domain Information
✅ **Implemented**: The system provides:

## Algorithm Details

### Skill Match Scoring Algorithm

```
overallScore = (
  skillCoverage * 0.35 +
  avgProficiency * 0.25 +
  avgRecency * 0.15 +
  certBonus * 0.10 +
  avgConfidence * 0.15
)
```

Where:
- **skillCoverage**: Percentage of required skills matched
- **avgProficiency**: Average proficiency level (expert=1.0, advanced=0.8, intermediate=0.6, beginner=0.3)
- **avgRecency**: Average recency score based on last-used dates
- **certBonus**: Bonus for certifications
- **avgConfidence**: Average confidence score from skill matrix

### Combined Relevance Scoring

```
relevanceScore = (
  skillScore * 0.40 +
  historicalScore * 0.25 +
  availabilityScore * 0.15 +
  efficiencyScore * 0.10 +
  collaborationScore * 0.10
)
```

### Load Assessment

**Overload Risk Calculation**:
- projectedUtilization = currentUtilization + (recommendedAllocation / committedHours)
- Risk levels:
  - `high`: projectedUtilization > 1.0
  - `medium`: projectedUtilization > 0.9
  - `low`: projectedUtilization > 0.8
  - `none`: projectedUtilization ≤ 0.8

**Buffer Days Calculation**:
- Critical priority: 0 days
- High priority: 1-3 days (based on utilization)
- Medium priority: 3-7 days (based on utilization)
- Low priority: 7-14 days (based on utilization)

## Mock Data

The service includes comprehensive mock data for 5 teams:
1. **Security Team**: Expert in security audits, vulnerability assessment, compliance
2. **Backend Team**: Expert in API development, database design, microservices
3. **Frontend Team**: Expert in React, TypeScript, UI/UX design
4. **DevOps Team**: Expert in AWS infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring
5. **Data Team**: Expert in data pipelines, analytics, database optimization

Each team has:
- 4+ skills with proficiency levels
- Capacity metrics (workload, available hours, efficiency)
- Historical performance data
- Similar project experience

## Production Considerations

### Database Integration
In production, the following methods should be updated to query actual databases:

1. **loadWorkgroupSkillMatrices()**: Query DynamoDB or RDS for team skill data
2. **loadHistoricalCollaborationData()**: Query collaboration history from database
3. Consider caching skill matrices (TTL: 24 hours) for performance

### Recommended Tables

**workgroup_skills table**:
- Partition Key: `team_id`
- Sort Key: `skill_name`
- Attributes: proficiency_level, years_experience, last_used, confidence_score, certification_level

**collaboration_history table**:
- Partition Key: `team_pair_id`
- Attributes: project_count, success_rate, collaboration_score, challenges, best_practices

**team_capacity table**:
- Partition Key: `team_id`
- Sort Key: `date`
- Attributes: current_workload, available_hours, efficiency_rating, collaboration_rating

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Skill matrices cached for 24 hours
2. **Parallel Processing**: Team evaluations can be parallelized
3. **Early Filtering**: Teams with skill match < 0.2 are filtered early
4. **Lazy Loading**: Historical data loaded only when needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train models on historical success patterns
2. **Real-time Capacity**: Integrate with project management tools for live capacity data
3. **Skill Recommendations**: Suggest skill development based on demand
4. **Team Formation**: Recommend optimal team compositions for projects
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast project success based on team composition
