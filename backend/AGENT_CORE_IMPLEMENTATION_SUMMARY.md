# AgentCore Service Implementation Summary

## Task 30: Implement AgentCore service architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Overview

Successfully implemented the AgentCore service as a centralized agent functionality hub with comprehensive conversation management, persona integration, and policy compliance checking.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. AgentCore Models (`src/models/agent-core.ts`)
- **AgentSession**: Session management with user context and conversation state
- **ConversationContext**: Message history, topics, artifacts, and action items
- **AgentDecision**: Decision-making with options, reasoning, and compliance
- **AgentLearning**: Learning patterns, user feedback, and improvements
- **Request/Response Types**: Complete API interface definitions
- **Error Types**: Specialized error classes for different failure scenarios

#### 2. AgentCore Service (`src/services/agent-core-service.ts`)
- **Session Management**: Start, manage, and end agent sessions
- **Message Processing**: Analyze user input and generate contextual responses
- **Persona Integration**: Apply leader personas to response generation
- **Compliance Checking**: Validate content against team policies
- **Knowledge Search**: Integration with Kendra for information retrieval
- **Decision Engine**: Make intelligent decisions based on context and policies
- **Learning System**: Store interaction patterns for continuous improvement

#### 3. Kendra Search Service (`src/services/kendra-search-service.ts`)
- **Amazon Kendra Integration**: Full SDK integration with fallback support
- **Search Functionality**: Query knowledge base with team-based access control
- **Result Processing**: Transform and rank search results with confidence scores
- **Suggestions**: Generate query suggestions and search feedback
- **Mock Support**: Fallback implementation when Kendra is not configured

#### 4. AgentCore Lambda Handler (`src/lambda/handlers/agent-core-handler.ts`)
- **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API for agent interactions
- **Session Operations**: Start, message, history, and end session endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP responses
- **Authentication**: User context extraction and validation
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring endpoint

#### 5. Rules Engine Enhancement (`src/rules-engine/rules-engine-service.ts`)
- **Content Validation**: Added `validateContent` method for policy compliance
- **Team-based Rules**: Filter rules by team restrictions
- **Violation Detection**: Check for prohibited terms and missing requirements
- **Scoring System**: Calculate compliance scores with severity weighting

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`src/services/__tests__/agent-core-service.test.ts`)
- **Unit Tests**: Complete test coverage for all service methods
- **Mock Integration**: Proper mocking of dependencies
- **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and edge cases
- **Session Lifecycle**: Test complete session workflow
