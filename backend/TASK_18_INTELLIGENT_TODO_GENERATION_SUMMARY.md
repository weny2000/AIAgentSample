3. **Machine Learning-Based Workload Estimation**
   - Category-specific base estimates (research: 8h, development: 16h, testing: 12h, etc.)
   - Complexity multipliers (1 + complexity * 1.5)
   - Risk-based time buffers (low: 1.1x, medium: 1.25x, high: 1.5x, critical: 2.0x)
   - Team efficiency factors from historical performance
   - Dependency-based buffer calculations
   - Confidence interval application using historical accuracy
   - Three-point estimation (optimistic, realistic, pessimistic)

   - Multi-factor suitability scoring:
     - Skill match score (35% weight)
     - Capacity score (25% weight)
     - Experience score (25% weight)
     - Availability score (15% weight)
   - Skill gap identification
