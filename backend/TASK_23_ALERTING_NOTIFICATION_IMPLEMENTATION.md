# Task 23: Alerting and Notification Mechanisms Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive alerting and notification mechanisms for the Work Task Analysis System. This implementation provides multi-channel alerting capabilities with CloudWatch alarms, SNS integration, and notifications via Slack, Teams, and Email.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Alarm Configuration System

#### Work Task Alarm Configuration (`work-task-alarm-config.ts`)
Created comprehensive alarm configurations covering all critical system aspects:

**Business Metric Alarms:**
- High error rate monitoring (>5% threshold)
- Low task completion rate detection (<50%)
- Quality check pass rate monitoring (<70%)
- Critical issues tracking (>10 in 5 minutes)
- User satisfaction monitoring (<3.0 rating)
- Quality score tracking (<60)
- Task submission monitoring (no submissions in 2 hours)

**Performance Degradation Alarms:**
- Slow analysis time detection (>3 minutes)
- High response time monitoring (>5 seconds)
- Quality check duration tracking (>1 minute)
- P99 operation duration monitoring (>10 seconds)
- Task processing time tracking (>2 minutes)

**System Health and Anomaly Alarms:**
- High operation failure rate (>20 failures in 10 minutes)
- Memory usage monitoring (>2GB)
- Error spike detection (>50 errors per minute)
- Low success rate alerts (<90%)
- High issues found tracking (>100 in 20 minutes)

**Data Quality Alarms:**
- High validation failures (>30 in 20 minutes)
- Data integrity error detection (>5 in 5 minutes)
- Missing required data monitoring (>20 in 20 minutes)
- Anomalous data pattern detection (>10 in 15 minutes)
- Metric inconsistency tracking (>15 in 30 minutes)

**Composite Alarms:**
- System degraded (multiple performance issues)
- Quality issues (multiple quality-related problems)
- Data quality degraded (multiple data issues)
- Critical system failure (severe operational problems)
- User experience degraded (multiple UX issues)

**Severity Levels:**
- Critical: Immediate attention required (24/7 on-call)
- High: Prompt attention needed (business hours)
- Medium: Investigation required
- Low: Monitoring and trend analysis

### 2. Alarm Manager (`alarm-manager.ts`)

- Alarm listing and statistics
- Alarm deletion and cleanup
- Alarm testing capabilities
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**SNS Topic Mapping:**

### 4. Setup and Automation Scripts

#### Alerting Setup Script (`setup-alerting.ts`)
Comprehensive CLI tool for alarm management:

**Commands:**
- `setup`: Create CloudWatch alarms with optional filters
- `list`: List all existing Work Task alarms
- `delete`: Delete all Work Task alarms
- `config`: Display severity configuration

**Options:**
- SNS topic configuration per severity level
- Category-based filtering (business, performance, system, data_quality)
- Severity-based filtering (critical, high, medium, low)
- Delete existing alarms before creation
- Composite alarm control
- Alarm testing after creation
- Dry-run mode for validation

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Create all alarms with SNS topics
ts-node src/scripts/setup-alerting.ts setup \
  --critical-topic arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:critical-alerts \
  --high-topic arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:high-alerts

# Create only business metric alarms
ts-node src/scripts/setup-alerting.ts setup --category business

## Architecture

### Alarm Flow
```
CloudWatch Metrics → CloudWatch Alarms → SNS Topics → Notification Service
                                                    ↓
                                    ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                                    ↓               ↓               ↓
                                  Slack          Teams           Email
```

### Severity-Based Routing
```
Critical Alarms → Critical SNS Topic → 24/7 On-Call Team
High Alarms     → High SNS Topic     → Business Hours Team
Medium Alarms   → Medium SNS Topic   → Investigation Queue
Low Alarms      → Low SNS Topic      → Monitoring Dashboard
```
