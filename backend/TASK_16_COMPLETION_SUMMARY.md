**Implementation**: Enhanced search with semantic similarity and contextual keywords ensures highly relevant project-specific results.

**Evidence**:
- Semantic scoring with 35% weight in combined algorithm
- Contextual keyword extraction from task content
- Technical term recognition and matching
- Team-specific pattern learning

### ✅ Requirement 3.2: Semantic Search and Relevance
**Implementation**: Cosine similarity-based semantic scoring with comprehensive text processing.

**Evidence**:
- Tokenization with stop word removal
- Cosine similarity calculation between queries and results
- Weighted scoring (title: 40%, excerpt: 30%, context: 30%)
- Pattern matching for technical terms

### ✅ Requirement 3.3: Historical Learning and Pattern Recognition
**Implementation**: Complete historical learning system with pattern storage and continuous improvement.

**Evidence**:
- DynamoDB-based pattern storage (search_history, search_patterns tables)
- Success rate tracking with exponential moving average (α = 0.2)
- Frequency-based pattern weighting
- User feedback integration for learning

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Semantic Similarity Scoring
- **Algorithm**: Cosine similarity with tokenization
- **Weight**: 35% of combined score
- **Features**:
  - Stop word removal
  - Context-aware matching
  - Multi-field scoring (title, excerpt, context)

### 2. Historical Learning
- **Storage**: DynamoDB tables with 90-day retention
- **Weight**: 25% of combined score
- **Features**:
  - Pattern frequency tracking
  - Success rate calculation
  - Exponential moving average updates
  - Team-specific learning

### 3. Pattern Matching
- **Types**: Technical, domain-specific, learned patterns
- **Weight**: 15% of combined score
- **Features**:
  - camelCase/PascalCase recognition
  - Hyphenated term extraction
  - Domain keyword matching
  - Historical pattern application

### 4. Combined Scoring Algorithm
```
Combined Score = (
  Kendra Confidence × 0.25 +
  Semantic Score × 0.35 +
  Historical Relevance × 0.25 +
  Pattern Match Score × 0.15
)
```
