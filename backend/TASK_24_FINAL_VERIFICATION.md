## Fixes Applied During Verification

### Fix 1: Off-Hours Restriction
**Issue:** Off-hours check was using current time instead of request timestamp

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
const now = new Date();
const hour = now.getHours();

// After
const timestamp = request.context.timestamp ? new Date(request.context.timestamp) : new Date();
const hour = timestamp.getHours();
```

**Result:** Test now passes ✅

### Fix 2: Permission Condition Evaluation
**Issue:** Field values without prefixes were not being checked in resourceMetadata

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added fallback to check resourceMetadata for fields without prefixes
if (context.resourceMetadata && field in context.resourceMetadata) {
  return context.resourceMetadata[field];
}
```

**Result:** Test now passes ✅
